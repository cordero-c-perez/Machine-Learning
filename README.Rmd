## Repository Description

This repository houses an ongoing series of projects, exploring Machine Learning methods via small projects. There will typically be three files for each project; one will contain the code (**.R**), another will be markdown (**.Rmd**), and the last (**.pdf**) can be viewed directly in github. The (.pdf) file description includes the associated project description.
