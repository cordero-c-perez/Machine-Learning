## ML Repo  
###### Note: data is not provided in the repository. Links are available in the README.

This repository houses an ongoing series of small projects exploring Machine
Learning methods. There will typically be three files
for each R project; one will contain pure code (**.R**), another will be
markdown (**.Rmd**), and the last (**.pdf**) can be viewed directly in
github. The pdf file description includes the associated project
description. There will be one file (.ipynb) for python projects as notebooks can be viewed directly in github.


## Files

#### kNN.pdf

Viewable output of kNN.rmd file. This projects applies kNN
classification to speech recognition data and aims to identify the “best
k” via bootstrapping. Classification accuracy serves as the measure of 
performance here and the data used for this project can be found
[here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Speaker+Accent+Recognition).


#### decision\_trees.pdf

Viewable output of decision\_trees.rmd file. This projects applies 4
methods for decision tree classification to diabetes data and aims to
improve each method given a business objective. Data used for this
project can be found
[here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset).


#### naive\_bayes.r

A naive bayes classification using text data: spam vs. no-spam
prediction
