Machine Learning Repository
================
C. Perez

## Repository Description

This repository houses an ongoing series of projects, exploring Machine
Learning methods via small projects. There will typically be three files
for each project; one will contain the code (**.R**), another will be
markdown (**.Rmd**), and the last (**.pdf**) can be viewed directly in
github. The (.pdf) file description includes the associated project
description.  

## Description of Files

#### kNN.r

A script file containing the code used in the “.rmd” file.

#### kNN.rmd

A markdown file with an output converted to “.pdf” for github viewer
compatibility.

#### kNN.pdf

Viewable output of kNN.rmd file. This projects applies kNN
classification to speech recognition data and aims to identify the “best
k” given the data present. Data used for this project can be found
[here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Speaker+Accent+Recognition).

#### naive\_bayes.r

A naive bayes classification using text data: spam vs. no-spam
prediction

#### decision\_trees.r

A script file containing the code used in the “.rmd” file.

#### decision\_trees.rmd

A markdown file with an output converted to “.pdf” for github viewer
compatibility.

#### decision\_trees.pdf

Viewable output of decision\_trees.rmd file. This projects applies 4
methods for decision tree classification to diabetes data and aims to
improve each method given a business objective. Data used for this
project can be found
[here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset).

#### README.rmd

This file creates a README.md file for the repository.
