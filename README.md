Machine Learning Repository
================
C. Perez

## Repository Description

This repository houses an ongoing series of projects, exploring Machine
Learning methods via small projects. There will typically be three files
for each project; one will contain the code (**.R**), another will be
markdown (**.Rmd**), and the last (**.pdf**) can be viewed directly in
github. The (.pdf) file description includes the associated project
description.  

## Description of Files

#### kNN.r

A script file containing the code used in the “.rmd” file.

#### kNN.rmd

A markdown file with an output converted to “.pdf” for github viewer
compatibility.

#### kNN.pdf

Viewable output of kNN.rmd file. This projects applies kNN
classification to speech recognition data and aims to identify the “best
k” given the data present. Data used for this project can be found
[here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Speaker+Accent+Recognition).

#### naive\_bayes.r

A naive bayes classification using text data: spam vs. no-spam
prediction

#### README.rmd

This file creates a README.md file for the repository.

###### Note: data is not provided in the repository. Links are available in the README.
